# SpaRe Dataset

SpaRe extends the [DTU dataset](https://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36). We believe that a fair evaluation protocol requires a larger sample of objects, including a subset such that test views are not publicly released. To this end, we replicate a DTU-alike setup in a synthetic
Blender environment.

## Scenes

We place all objects on a white platform and place them in a black box. We manually collected $102$ assets from [BlenderKit](https://www.blenderkit.com). All the collected models are high-quality 3D assets belonging to a range of categories, including toys, cars and houses miniatures, home appliances and equipment, technology items, tools, sports equipment, plants, decorations *etc*. A breakdown of categories seen in SpaRe is presented below:

The scenes span a large range of objects sized between 8cm and 50cm. We include items varying in texture and specularity (*eg.* a plushy elephant, a glass lamp, or a shiny plastic children's toy).
